Goal: Create a simple "hello world" TabletopKit app (tested somehow to see if it works)

- table
- equipment (something simple like a ball that can be passed) or a button for each player that when pressed makes them "active"?
- state - who touched it last?
- game rules - something simple to demonstrate that the current player can be passed along after an action
