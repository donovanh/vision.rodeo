Just a few weeks ago I [picked up a Vision Pro](/vision-pro-week-one/) and I've been learning loads about what it means to develop in visionOS.

My first project was to take this [basic Jenga demo](/jenga-in-vision-os/) and try to make it something actually playable, even fun! Introducing BlockStack, [available now on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1e8wHwE9).

**BlockStack for Vision Pro!** This single-player game is relaxing way to play virtual Jenga. Challenge yourself to get the high score. Customise your experience with beautiful themes. Have fun!

## TestFlight version now available

I've uploaded my first build of the game [to TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1e8wHwE9). To install, make sure you have the TestFlight app then select "Start Testing" on the linked page.

As I'm using some of the newer APIs introduced in Xcode 16, this version of the app requires [vision OS 2](https://www.apple.com/visionos/visionos-2-preview/). Apologies for anyone on version 1 currently.
